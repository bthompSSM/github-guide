# Creating a Repository

Consult the [GitHub
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)
for the most up-to-date information on how to create a repository.

## Naming your repository

- Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the repository.
- Use lowercase letters for the repository name.
- Use dashes to separate words in the repository name.
- Avoid using spaces in the repository name.
- Avoid using special characters in the repository name.
- Avoid using uppercase letters in the repository name.
- Prefix your team's repositories with an abbreviation of your team's name.
    - For example, if your team's name is "Cloud Genesis", you could use "cg" as the abbreviation
      (i.e., `cg-project-name`).
