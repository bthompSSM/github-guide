# GitHub Roles

Organization owners can assign
[roles](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)
to individuals and teams, giving them different levels of access to different parts of the organization.

## Repository Roles

You can [customize access to each repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-in-your-repository)
by assigning granular roles, giving people access to the features and tasks they need.  You can give
organization members, team members, and outside collaborators different levels of access to
different repositories.

From least to most access, the roles for a repository are:

- **Read**: Recommended for non-code contributors who want to view or discuss your project.
- **Triage**: Recommended for contributors who need to manage issues, discussions, and pull requests
  without write access.
- **Write**: Recommended for contributors who need to push code to the repository.
- **Maintain**: Recommended for repository administrators who need to manage the repository without
  access to sensitive or destructive actions.
- **Admin**: Recommended for people who need full access to the repository, including sensitive and
  destructive actions like managing security or deleting the repository.

### Owner

The owner of a repository is the individual or organization that initially creates the repository.
The owner can:

- Invite other users to join the repository as collaborators
- Manage repository settings
- Manage repository content
