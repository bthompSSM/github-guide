# Creating a Branch

To create a new branch, you can use the following command:

```bash
git branch [branch-name]
```

Then, you can switch to the new branch using the following command:

```bash
git checkout [branch-name]
```

You can also do the same thing in one step using the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b [branch-name]
```
