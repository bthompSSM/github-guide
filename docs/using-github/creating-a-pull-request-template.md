# Creating a Pull Request Template

## What is a pull request template?

A pull request (PR) template is a markdown file that provides a standardized structure for
contributors to follow when submitting pull requests on GitHub. It ensures that all necessary
information—such as a description of changes, related issues, and testing instructions—is
included, making the review process smoother and more efficient.

## Why use a pull request template?

- **Consistency:** Ensures every PR follows the same format, making it easier for reviewers to find
  key information.
- **Clarity:** Guides contributors to provide essential details, reducing back-and-forth communication.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlines the review process by ensuring reviewers have all the context they
  need upfront.
- **Quality:** Encourages thoroughness, such as including testing steps or linking related issues.
