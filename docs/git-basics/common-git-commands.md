# Common Git Commands

You can find a list of all Git commands [on the official Git documentation
site](https://git-scm.com/docs).  Listed below are some of the most common Git commands you will use
on a daily basis.

## [`git init`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init)

Initializes a new Git repository in your project folder.

## [`git clone [url]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone)

Copies an existing Git repository from a remote server (like GitHub) to your local machine.

## [`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status)

Shows you the current state of your working directory—whether files have been changed, added, or are
ready to be committed.

## [`git add [file]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add)

Stages a file (or files) for the next commit. It’s like saying, “Hey Git, include these changes in
the next snapshot.”

## [`git commit -m "message"`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)

Saves the staged changes with a descriptive message explaining what you did.

## [`git push`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push)

Uploads your local commits to a remote repository (like GitHub), so others can see and collaborate
on your work.

Fetches the latest changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch.

## [`git branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)

Lists all the branches in your repository (branches are like parallel versions of your project).

## [`git checkout [branch]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)

Switches to a different branch to work on a different version of your project.

## [`git merge [branch]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge)

Combines the changes from one branch into another, usually to bring new features into the main
project.

## [`git fetch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch)

Fetches the latest changes from a remote repository without merging them.
